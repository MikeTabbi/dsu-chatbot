# DSU Chatbot

A chatbot that answers general questions about Delaware State University using public DSU information, with answers grounded in (and linked to) official sources.

## How it works

- **Question path:** chat widget on dsu.edu → backend API → retriever finds relevant DSU content → Claude writes an answer with source links.
- **Data path:** ingestion job crawls DSU sources on a schedule, splits pages into chunks, and stores them in a search index.
- **Feedback:** answers are logged with thumbs up/down so gaps in the knowledge base can be fixed.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details.
